Steps to work with your local git and github remote repository

USE CLONE TO COPY YOUR REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL GIT REPOSITORY

	Get the github url from your github repos like the following:
	https://github.com/pshapard/CoronaVirus.git
	from your local git console type the following.  Be sure to be in the local git folder you want to download the remote repos to.
	git clone https://github.com/pshapard/CoronaVirus.git
C:\Users\shapard\new_projects_repo\CoronaVirus

Now that you have your local and remote repository sync'ed.  Write your code, in my case, python scripts from the folder, such as
C:\Users\shapard\new_projects_repo\CoronaVirus\ClassesFuncs.py
Once you made your changes, type the following at the git console:
$git add ClassesFuncs.py
$git commit -m "Change date updated and version"
$git push

At this point your local and remote repository are sync'ed
